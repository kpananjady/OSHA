Management not to conduct the annual fit testing at the annual mandatory training sessions in approx. June 2019.  As a result, members of SEMS were not up-to-date on their fit testing requirements when COVID-19 crisis started, and some SEMS staff had not been fit tested at all prior to COVID despite being full-time employees exposed to TB, influenza, and other airborne illnesses in a healthcare setting. 

In addition, Stamford EMS provided staff with N95 masks that were of a different make/model/design than the masks which we were (eventually) fit tested, or had been fit tested with in the past. 

To date, numerous full-time and per diem (especially) staff have ridden on 911 ambulance shifts, exposed to COVID-19, WITHOUT being EVER fit tested, let alone annually fit tested as required by OSHA. (I have not been fit tested in some years by SEMS, though ride at least a 12 hour shift or two a month.)  (I believe that many of the volunteer EMT members of SEMS have also likewise NEVER been fit tested for an N95 respirator, but actively ride on 911 ambulances.) 

Stamford EMS suffered a very high rate of personnel with COVID-19 as a result (Up to 1/3 of FT staff infected). 

There are numerous witnesses to this egregious violation of employee safety. A simple comparison of the full time, per diem, and volunteer roster to the fit testing records will illustrate the extraordinary complacency SEMS has when it comes to employee safety.
